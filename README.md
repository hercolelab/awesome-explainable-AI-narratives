# Awesome Narrative Explainable AI
We present a curated collection of research and resources on **Narrative Explainable AI (Narrative XAI)**, highlighting approaches that bridge **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Explainable AI (XAI)** to create user-centric and intuitively understandable explanations.

We will keep focusing on this field and updating relevant information ðŸ’¡ ðŸ”„ ðŸ§

A predictive model processes input data to generate an output. Traditional explainers often provide only technical or low-level interpretations (red âœ—). By incorporating contextual information and leveraging a large language model (LLM), the system delivers clearer, user-oriented explanations (green âœ“), making model outcomes easier to understand.
