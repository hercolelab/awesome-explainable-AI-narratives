# Awesome Narrative Explainable AI
We present a curated collection of research and resources on **Narrative Explainable AI (Narrative XAI)**, highlighting approaches that bridge **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Explainable AI (XAI)** to create user-centric and intuitively understandable explanations.

A predictive model processes input data to generate an output. Traditional explainers often provide only technical or low-level interpretations (red âœ—). By incorporating contextual information and leveraging a large language model (LLM), the system delivers clearer, user-oriented explanations (green âœ“), making model outcomes easier to understand.

# Narrative Explainable AI with large Language Models
We distinguish contributions that focus on tabular data, graph-structured data, image data (Section 5.3), and reinforcement-learning policies, as these modalities entail distinct representational challenges, explanation requirements, and
narrative strategies. All these works are summarised below.
